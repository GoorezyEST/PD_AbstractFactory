# Abstract Factory 

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 

It defines a factory abstract class and subclasses to create the concrete objects, allowing for greater flexibility and separation of object creation and usage. 

This pattern is useful for creating related objects in a flexible and maintainable way.
